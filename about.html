            <p> My name is Sharon Hwang and I am a third-year majoring in Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego. </p>

<p>My interest in sustainable living began about 6 years ago, when I found a packet of basil seeds lying around the house. After haphazardly following instructions behind the packet, I was amazed to see actual sprouts a few days later.  Since then, my garden has included many other herbs, veggies, and flowers. Although it was an activity that started out purely as a hobby, research online showed the benefits of growing your own food. Due to the lack of workable area, I focused on container gardening and found that you don't actually need a garden to grow your own food! Space constraint forced me to be creative with space and the different containers and arranging allowed me to customize and view growing as a type of art. </p>

<p>One of my favorite phrases is l'arte d'arrangiarst, which can be translated to the art of making something out of nothing. Transforming trash into an art is really appealing to me and there are so many creative people out there. I love browsing blogs like recyclart.org and becoming inspired to make my own recycled art. Some of the recycled art I have made include a shoerack out of corn nuts boxes and various wall art made of magazines and old jeans. </p>
